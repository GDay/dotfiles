## My personal dotfiles

### Installing
* Install [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Preferably build from source, because not all packagemanagers have the latest version.
* Clone repo to a folder in your home folder `cd ~/ && git clone git@github.com:GDay/dotfiles.git`.
* Run `stow */` to link all config files.
